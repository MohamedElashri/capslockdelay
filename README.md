# macOS CapsLock Delay Configuration Tool

## Description
This tool provides a simple and user-friendly way to configure the delay of the CapsLock key on macOS systems. It allows users to either set a specific delay in milliseconds for the CapsLock activation or to disable the CapsLock delay entirely. This is particularly useful for users who find themselves frequently activating CapsLock unintentionally or those who wish to customize their keyboard behavior for better productivity.
